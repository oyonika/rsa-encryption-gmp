* Problem statement *: 
Suppose Alice has a list of friends X = fx1; x2;    ; xng, and Bob has a friend y. Bob wishes to
test whether friend y belongs to Alice's friend list, i.e., y 2? X. Alice does not wish to reveal her
friend list as she is concerned about the privacy of her friend list, but Bob is ne to reveal his friend
y to Alice. Figure 1 describes a private set membership protocol where Alice proves to Bob whether
y 2 X by computing a proof Z or (b; gô€€€a). Alice publishes accX before as a reference signature for
her friend list. Please implement the protocol in Figure 1 in a single code and submit the source
code of your implementation.
