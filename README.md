Suppose Alice has a list of friends X and Bob has a friend y. Bob wishes to test whether friend y belongs to Alice's friend list, i.e., y 2? X. Alice does not wish to reveal her friend list as she is concerned about the privacy of her friend list, but Bob is fine to reveal his friend y to Alice. Please implement the rsa protocol in a single code file.
